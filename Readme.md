This is a tool for decoding all the images/animations/maps from classic DOS Lemmings :)

## Animations

![Brick laying](https://github.com/chrishulbert/digger-decoder/blob/main/readme/brick_laying.png?raw=true)

This outputs uncompressed PNG / APNG files. If that concerns you, you can compress them like so:

    brew install apngasm
    brew install pngquant
    make compress
